## üìö Introduction

Astrophysics combines physics and astronomy to understand celestial phenomena. In my final year, I delved into various projects that applied mathematical modeling and statistical methods to real-world problems in space science. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my work, showcasing the intersection of theory and practical application.

## üå† Project Overview

The projects in this repository include:

1. **Orbital Transfer Optimization**: This project employs gradient descent techniques to find the most efficient paths for spacecraft maneuvers. By minimizing fuel consumption and time, we can enhance mission success rates.
